# Context:

A colleague at work needed help getting pertinent information out of a 23 page .pdf manual that was written in German.

To translate the manual into English, he was manually copying and pasting blocks of text from it into Google Translate web text input box. Google translate only allows a maximum of 3900 characters at once, so translating the entire manual would've taken quite a bit of time and effort.

This app allows a user to upload a .pdf or text file written in another language and to download a Word document version of it translated into English (via Google's Translation API).

# To run:
- Run `npm i` to install the needed dependencies
- Go to source `cd src`
- Run `npx tsx transformText.ts` to run the main typescript file locally
